<h2>Economists</h2>
<p>Economists are growing increasingly concerned about South Africa’s economy. This is because the country’s three major macroeconomic problems – lacklustre economic growth, growing inflation and very high unemployment – have been exacerbated by a series of major disruptions.</p> 
<p>These include the COVID pandemic that started as a health crisis but escalated quickly to an economic crisis. Millions of people lost their jobs as economic activity came to a halt under lockdown.</p>
<p>In the middle of the pandemic violence that lasted for eight days erupted in Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng. Further pressure has been piled on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which is pushing up food prices.

    The most recent blow has been devastating floods in some parts of the country that caused loss of lives and massive destruction of infrastructure, including to the country’s biggest port in Durban.

    <p>. Mark Zuckerberg’s First Idea Was a Site Called Facemash
        When Zuckerberg was in Harvard, he had the idea of creating a site that allowed users to compare people’s faces.
        
        With the platform, users could pick “who’s hotter.”
        
        Not surprisingly, his idea didn’t impress Harvard’s administrators.
        
        Zuckerberg’s project was shut down and he was threatened with expulsion.
        
         Zuckerberg’s Second Idea Was an Online Student Directory
        He called the directory “Thefacebook.” People who used it could:
        
        Search for other Harvard students.
        Find out who else was taking the classes they were in.
        Look up friends of their friends.
        Create a social network.
        Although “Thefacebook” started out as an exclusive directory for Harvard students, it soon grew to include anyone above 13.
